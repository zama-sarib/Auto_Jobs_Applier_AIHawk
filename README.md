## Configuration

### 1. secrets.yaml

This file contains sensitive information. Never share or commit this file to version control.

- `llm_api_key: [Your OpenAI or Ollama API key or Gemini API key]`
  - Replace with your OpenAI API key for GPT integration
  - To obtain an API key, follow the tutorial at: https://medium.com/@lorenzozar/how-to-get-your-own-openai-api-key-f4d44e60c327
  - Note: You need to add credit to your OpenAI account to use the API. You can add credit by visiting the [OpenAI billing dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing).
  - According to the [OpenAI community](https://community.openai.com/t/usage-tier-free-to-tier-1/919150) and our users' reports, right after setting up the OpenAI account and purchasing the required credits, users still have a `Free` account type. This prevents them from having unlimited access to OpenAI models and allows only 200 requests per day. This might cause runtime errors such as:  
    `Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details. ...}}`  
    `{'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for gpt-4o-mini in organization <org> on requests per day (RPD): Limit 200, Used 200, Requested 1.}}`  
    OpenAI will update your account automatically, but it might take some time, ranging from a couple of hours to a few days.  
    You can find more about your organization limits on the [official page](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits).
  - For obtaining Gemini API key visit [Google AI for Devs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key)

### PLUS. data_folder_example

The `data_folder_example` folder contains a working example of how the files necessary for the bot's operation should be structured and filled out. This folder serves as a practical reference to help you correctly set up your work environment for the job search bot.

#### Contents

Inside this folder, you'll find example versions of the key files:

- `secrets.yaml`
- `config.yaml`
- `plain_text_resume.yaml`

These files are already populated with fictitious but realistic data. They show you the correct format and type of information to enter in each file.

#### Usage

Using this folder as a guide can be particularly helpful for:

1. Understanding the correct structure of each configuration file
2. Seeing examples of valid data for each field
3. Having a reference point while filling out your personal files


## Usage
0. **Account language**
   To ensure the bot works, your account language must be set to English.
   
2. **Data Folder:**
   Ensure that your data_folder contains the following files:
   - `secrets.yaml`
   - `config.yaml`
   - `plain_text_resume.yaml`

3. **Run the Bot:**

   Auto_Jobs_Applier_AIHawk offers flexibility in how it handles your pdf resume:

- **Dynamic Resume Generation:**
  If you don't use the `--resume` option, the bot will automatically generate a unique resume for each application. This feature uses the information from your `plain_text_resume.yaml` file and tailors it to each specific job application, potentially increasing your chances of success by customizing your resume for each position.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
- **Using a Specific Resume:**
  If you want to use a specific PDF resume for all applications, place your resume PDF in the `data_folder` directory and run the bot with the `--resume` option:
  ```bash
  python main.py --resume /path/to/your/resume.pdf
  ```
- **Using the colled mode:**
  If you want to collect job data only to perform any type of data analytics you can use the bot with the `--collect` option. This will store in output/data.json file all data found from linkedin jobs offers.
  ```bash
  python main.py --collect
  ```


### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### 1. OpenAI API Rate Limit Errors

**Error Message:**

openai.RateLimitError: Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details. For more information on this error, read the docs: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/error-codes/api-errors.', 'type': 'insufficient_quota', 'param': None, 'code': 'insufficient_quota'}}

**Solution:**
- Check your OpenAI API billing settings at https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
- Ensure you have added a valid payment method to your OpenAI account
- Note that ChatGPT Plus subscription is different from API access
- If you've recently added funds or upgraded, wait 12-24 hours for changes to take effect
- Free tier has a 3 RPM limit; spend at least $5 on API usage to increase

#### 2. Easy Apply Button Not Found

**Error Message:**

Exception: No clickable 'Easy Apply' button found

**Solution:**
- Ensure that you're logged properly
- Check if the job listings you're targeting actually have the "Easy Apply" option
- Verify that your search parameters in the `config.yaml` file are correct and returning jobs with the "Easy Apply" button
- Try increasing the wait time for page loading in the script to ensure all elements are loaded before searching for the button

#### 3. Incorrect Information in Job Applications

**Issue:** Bot provides inaccurate data for experience, CTC, and notice period

**Solution:**
- Update prompts for professional experience specificity
- Add fields in `config.yaml` for current CTC, expected CTC, and notice period
- Modify bot logic to use these new config fields

#### 4. YAML Configuration Errors

**Error Message:**

yaml.scanner.ScannerError: while scanning a simple key

**Solution:**
- Copy example `config.yaml` and modify gradually
- Ensure proper YAML indentation and spacing
- Use a YAML validator tool
- Avoid unnecessary special characters or quotes

#### 5. Bot Logs In But Doesn't Apply to Jobs

**Issue:** Bot searches for jobs but continues scrolling without applying

**Solution:**
- Check for security checks or CAPTCHAs
- Verify `config.yaml` job search parameters
- Ensure your account profile meets job requirements
- Review console output for error messages

### General Troubleshooting Tips

- Use the latest version of the script
- Verify all dependencies are installed and updated
- Check internet connection stability
- Clear browser cache and cookies if issues persist
